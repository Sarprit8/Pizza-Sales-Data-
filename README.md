# Pizza-Sales-Data-
Thrilled to share Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project, where I explored key business insights for a pizza chain using SQL for querying and Excel for data cleaning and dashboard creation — without using Power BI this time, to sharpen my Excel visualization skills.
 Solved critical business problems such as:
  Identifying top-selling & low-performing pizzas
  Analyzing category & size-wise sales distribution
  Extracting peak order times and days
  Calculating key metrics like Total Revenue, Average Order Value, and Total Pizzas Sold
Developed an interactive Excel dashboard showcasing daily/hourly order trends, pizza category/size performance — all modeled to help drive data-driven business decisions.
This end-to-end project reflects my ability to handle the full data workflow: SQL querying → Excel data transformation → Dashboard building.
Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
